### {% bloginfo "Footed Egg" "Ulas Kaygisiz" %}

I'm having a hard time remembering how long I've been traveling in this galaxy. I always write down the interesting and beautiful things I see in my notebook, but what I encountered today was the most interesting thing I have encountered so far. I was about to rest for a while when I caught sight of something in the distance. It looked like an egg at first. I guessed that I was very hungry and I thought that I missed the fried eggs that my grandmother used to prepare for breakfast. However, the egg started to approach me. This egg had arms and legs. I wanted to go to him and see if I could communicate with him. As I approached the egg, my friend stopped me and told me that the eggs on this galaxy were deceiving us into wanting to eat them and poison and kill us. I left the place without approaching the egg. I still think maybe I was too hungry and this was all a dream. But if you see an egg with arms and legs, stay away.
