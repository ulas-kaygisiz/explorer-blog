### {% bloginfo "Nelanbu Attack" "Ulas Kaygisiz" %}


A day in this galaxy is never normal. While I was sipping my cocktail with my close friend, I was startled by a large object passing quickly over me. Before I knew what was happening, I stood up and ran towards my house. When I took my gun and turned around, I noticed the red smoke surrounding me. The Nelanbus had come again, but this time their numbers were much greater. I remember the first time I fought a Nelanbu. I didn't know anything back then and it took a really long time to defeat them. But this time, I immediately went back home and brewed tea. If black tea comes into contact with a Nelanbu, they feel a dizzyness and lose themselves. I used nearly 10 cups of tea, but eventually I managed to defeat them all. If you encounter a Nelanbu one day, do not forget to fight them with black tea.
